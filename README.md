# Tic-tac-toe-Ultimate
TicTacToe Ultimate is a complex variation of the standard TicTacToe that is played by two players. 

The game board consists of 3X3 standard TicTacToe boards. The two players play by marking the slots with X and O alternately.
The two players take turns marking slots X and O and the winner is the one who manages to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.
Game play ends when either a player wins the global board, or there are no legal moves remaining.
